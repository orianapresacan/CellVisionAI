# BioVisionAI

## Overview
BioVisionAI offers a comprehensive exploration into the dynamic world of autophagy cells through the lens of machine learning. This project encompasses a wide range of tasks including segmentation, classification, object tracking, and next-frame prediction, all aimed at advancing our understanding of autophagy cell behaviors.

## Repository Structure
- `Classification/` - Models and scripts for cell classification.
- `DatasetAnalysis/` - Code used for exploratory data analysis on the CELLULAR dataset.
- `ObjectDetectionTracking/` - Tools for detecting and tracking cells in image sequences.
- `Segmentation/` - Segmentation models for isolating cells within images.
- `NextFramePrediction/`

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Choose a directory of interest.
3. Follow README instructions within the directory to set up and run models.
